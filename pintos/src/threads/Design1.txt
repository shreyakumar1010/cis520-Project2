                 ALARM CLOCK
                 ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----
We created a list named sleeperCells, which ...

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to your timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?


>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> other designs that you considered?



             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?


              ADVANCED SCHEDULER [EXTRA CREDIT]
              =================================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C5: Briefly critique your design, pointing out advantages and
>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?
